# nzilbb.labbcat package for R

The package provides functionality for querying and extracting data
from LaBB-CAT corpora, directly from R.

It currently provides access to quite basic data, but does
include a function for extraction sound fragments given a transcript
name and start/end times, so results CSV files can be processed
directy from R.

## Building the package

The package can be built using:  
`./build.sh`

## Basic usage instructions

### Getting started

To install the package:

```{r install}
install.packages("nzilbb.labbcat")
```

To use it:

```{r require}
require(nzilbb.labbcat)
```

Finally, to communicate with a particular instance of LaBB-CAT, you need to use the `labbcat.instance` function, specifying the URL of the LaBB-CAT instance - e.g. "https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo/".  If you want to connect to your own instance and don't know the correct URL, log in to LaBB-CAT with your browser, click the *home* link on the menu, and copy the URL that's in your browser's address box.

If you're using R in interactive mode, it's best to just specify the URL, like this: `labbcat.instance("https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo/")`

If LaBB-CAT is password-protected, you will then be asked to enter the username and password.

If you're not in interactive mode, then you must specify the username and the password as the second and third parameters to the function:

```{r labbcat.instance}
labbcat <- labbcat.instance("https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo/", "demo", "demo")
```

The function returns a variable that you must use as the first parameter for all the other LaBB-CAT functions.

### Basic informational functions

There are some basic functions that provide information about the LaBB-CAT instance you're using.

```{r basic-info}
id <- labbcat.getId(labbcat)
layers <- labbcat.getLayerIds(labbcat)
corpora <- labbcat.getCorpusIds(labbcat)

paste("LaBB-CAT instance", id, "has", length(layers), "layers. The corpora are:")
corpora
```

### Accessing specific transcript and participant IDs

Transcripts are called 'graphs' because each one is represented as an 'Annotation Graph' (see Bird & Liberman 2001)

You can get a complete list of participants and transcripts:

```{r participants-graphs}
participants <- labbcat.getParticipantIds(labbcat)
transcripts <- labbcat.getGraphIds(labbcat)

paste("There are", length(participants), "participants. The first one is", participants[1])
paste("There are", length(transcripts), "transcripts. The first one is", transcripts[1])

```

There are also ways to get a filtered list of transcripts:

```{r listing-graph-ids}
## Transcripts in the UC corpus:
labbcat.getGraphIdsInCorpus(labbcat, "UC")

## Transcripts featuring the participant QB1602:
labbcat.getGraphIdsWithParticipant(labbcat, "QB1602")

## Transcripts with 'YW' in their name:
labbcat.getMatchingGraphIdsPage(labbcat, "id MATCHES '.*YW.*'")

```

### Accessing Media

Given a graph ID (i.e. a transcript name) you can access information about what media it has available:

```{r media}
## Default WAV URL:
labbcat.getMedia(labbcat, "AP2515_ErrolHitt.eaf")

media <- labbcat.getAvailableMedia(labbcat, "AP2515_ErrolHitt.eaf")

## All media file names
media$name

## Their URLs
media$url
```

Once you've got a URL, you can save its contents using the *httr* package, something like this:

```
install.packages("httr")

wav.file <- media$name[1]
wav.url <- media$url[1]

response <- httr::GET(wav.url, labbcat$authorization, httr::write_disk(wav.file, overwrite=TRUE), httr::progress())
if (httr::status_code(response) != 200) { # 200 means OK
  print(paste("Downloading", wav.file, "failed:", httr::http_status(response)$message))
} else {
  print(paste("Downloading", wav.file, "worked!"))
  
  ## Tidily delete the file we just downloaded
  file.remove(wav.file)
}
```

### Media fragments

You can access a selected fragment of a wav file with `labbcat.getSoundFragment`. The function downloads a wav file to the current working directory, and returns the name of the file:

```{r media-fragment}
wav.file <- labbcat.getSoundFragment(labbcat, "AP2505_Nelson.eaf", 10.0, 15.0)

paste("The third 5 seconds is in this file:", wav.file)

## tidily delete the file we just downloaded
file.remove(wav.file)
```

`labbcat.getSoundFragment` also accepts vectors for the `id`, `start`, and `end` parameters:

```{r media-fragments}
results <- data.frame(
  id=c("AP2505_Nelson.eaf", "AP2512_MattBlack.eaf", "AP2512_MattBlack.eaf"),
  start=c(10.0, 20.0, 30.0),
  end=c(15.0, 25.0, 35.0))

wav.files <- labbcat.getSoundFragment(labbcat, results$id, results$start, results$end, no.progress = TRUE)

wav.files

## tidily delete the files we just downloaded
file.remove(wav.files)
```

This means that, if you have a results csv file exported from LaBB-CAT, which identifies segment tokens, you can iterate through the rows, downloading the corresponding wav files, something like:

```
## load the results from the CSV file
results <- read.csv("results.csv", header=T)

## download all the segment WAV files
wav.files <- labbcat.getSoundFragment(
    labbcat, results$Transcript, results$segments.start, results$segments.end)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Getting annotations from other layers

It would be good to be able to get labels from other layers, like you can in LaBB-CAT using the *insert data* page.  Something like:

```
results <- read.csv("results.csv", header=T)
frequencies <- labbcat.getAnnotations(labbcat, results$MatchId, "frequency")
```

Sometimes you might want annotations for the previous or next token, which might work like this:

```
previous.token.frequencies <- labbcat.getAnnotations(labbcat, results$MatchId, "frequency", token=-1)
next.token.frequencies <- labbcat.getAnnotations(labbcat, results$MatchId, "frequency", token=1)
```

### Looking up dictionaries

LaBB-CAT maintains a number of [dictionaries](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/demo/dictionaries) it uses to look things up.  These include access to CELEX, LIWC, and other lexicons that might be set up in the LaBB-CAT instance.

It might be useful to be able to process a results CSV file, or in fact any list of words from any source, by looking up a specific dictionary:

```
words <- c("the", "quick", "brown", "fox")
pos <- labbcat.lookup(labbcat, "CELEX-EN", "Syntax")
```

### Process with Praat

Another process that involves uploading a results CSV file is the *process with praat* option.  It would be good to be able to do this directly from R.

One tricky thing is that the *process with praat* page in LaBB-CAT has a bunch of options that would need to be specifiable somehow in the R function, including:
* the start and end time columns
* the window offset (surrounding context to extract)
* which measurements to make, including their options:
  * formats
    * F1, F2, and/or F3
    * how many sample points and where they should be in the interval
    * max formants for 'female' and 'male' participants
    * the exact Praat command to use
  * pitch
    * min, mean, and/or max
    * pitch floor for 'female' and 'male' participants
    * pitch ceiling for 'female' and 'male' participants
    * voicing threshold for 'female' and 'male' participants
    * the exact praat command to use
  * intensity maximum
    * the exact praat command to use
  * centre of gravity
    * p=2, p=1 and/or p=â…”

There's also a newish option on the page for specifying a custom script, which could look something like this:
```
# get centre of gravity and spread from spectrum
spectrum = To Spectrum... yes
# filter it
Filter (pass Hann band)... 1000 22000 100
# get centre of gravity
cog = Get centre of gravity... 2
# extract the result back out into a CSV column called 'cog'
print 'cog:0' 'newline$'
# tidy up objects
select spectrum
Remove
```

There are a few options for how to specify these from within R. The easiest would be to decide that only a limited set of options is initially available, something like this:

```
results <- read.csv("results.csv", header=T)
praat.results <- labbcat.processWithPraat(labbcat, 
  results$MatchId, results$segments.start, results$segments.end, window.offset=0.5, 
  formant.F1=TRUE, formant.F2=TRUE, 
  pitch.mean=TRUE)
```

Alternatively, or later on, more possible parameters could maybe be added:

```
praat.results <- labbcat.processWithPraat(labbcat, 
  results$MatchId, results$segments.start, results$segments.end, window.offset=0.5, 
  formant.F1=TRUE, formant.F2=TRUE, 
  formant.sample.points=c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)), 
  formant.max.female=5000, formant.max.male=5500)
```

I'm not sure whether it makes sense to include the possibility of a custom Praat script, but if so, it could be another possible parameter:

```
## Read the Praat script from a file
script.file <- "coolStuff.praat""
script <- readChar(script.file, file.info(script.file)$size)

## Run the Praat script on each token
praat.results <- labbcat.processWithPraat(labbcat, 
  results$MatchId, results$segments.start, results$segments.end, window.offset=0.5, 
  praat.script=script)
```

### Retrieving transcript attributes

Something like: 

```
attributes <- labbcat.getTranscriptAttributes(labbcat, id.list, c("language","duration"))
```

### Retrieving participant attributes

Something like: 

```
attributes <- labbcat.getGraphAttributes(labbcat, participant.list, c("dob","gender"))
```

### Search

To be able to do 'everything' from within R, there needs to be a way of conducting searches, 
something like:

```
results <- labbcat.search(labbcat, "segments.label MATCHES 'I'", participants=participant.list)
```

How the search language might work (i.e. the "segments.label MATCHES 'I'" part), I'm not sure about yet.

### Credentials and Security

Finally, having usernames and passwords potentially saved to script
files or typed out in front of others is inherently insecure. Some
mechanism will be invented which makes this unnecessary.  That might
involve:
* having usernames/passwords stored in a file separate from the main script
* using some GUI package that allows hidden entry of passwords
